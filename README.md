# Server Side Calculator

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

My calculator program is able to take in two number inputs, an operator, and respond with a result. There is a 'C' button that will clear the fields and allow the user to make a new computation. if there is an empty field or an operator that wasn't chosen, the program won't allow you to continue until all fields are used. 

A problem I came across was when I tried to GET my data that was on my server. I realized that I was responding with a number in my app.get route. I fixed this problem by pushing the answers to an array. Another problem I came across was looping through both arrays to display the history and most recent answer. I realized I didn't need to loop through my array of answers but only display the answer in the last index, which is the most recent answer.
